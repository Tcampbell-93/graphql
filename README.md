# graphql

## Description
In this week I learned about graphql. I was tasked with switching an already working application with a REST API to graphql. I found this task very complicated to work with someone else's code and try to match everything up with my code. 

## Installation 
When you open the app in the root file run npm install to install all the dependencies.

## Usage
To use this app you can search for books you like and save the books. After you can go to your profile to look at the books you have saved and delete the ones you have already read.
